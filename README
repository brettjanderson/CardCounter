Card Counting
- by Brett Anderson -
======================

This project is a simple card counting application that will help you count
cards while playing live blackjack at your online casino of choice.


HOW IT WORKS
-------------------
Some online casinos will have a live blackjack game where you can play
against an actual video recorded dealer, dealing very real cards. This
program seeks to take advantage of this by tracking the cards that are
dealt, keeping a "count" on the deck, so that useful information about
the state of the deck can be gleened and used.

At any point during the game you can enter your hand into the prompt at
the top right corner of the window and the dealers up card in order to
run a Monte Carlo simulation with the unique deck being tracked by the
counter.  10,000 simulations take place with randomized versions of the
deck and win/lose statistics are displayed showing which action to take,
hit or stay.


Specifically, during the game, track the cards being dealt by clicking
on the card that comes out from the row on the left hand side of the
window.  Face cards are all tracked using the "F" button. The "A" button
is for Ace cards.

To run simulations,  put in the respective symbol for your cards and the
dealers cards using this table and press the "Run Monte Carlo" button:

Ace :   A
2   :   2
3   :   3
4   :   4
5   :   5
6   :   6
7   :   7
8   :   8
9   :   9
10  :   F
J   :   F
Q   :   F
K   :   F

At any point, you can start over with a brand new deck by clicking the
"New Deck" button.

The expected return values quoted when running the Monte Carlo simulation
are the expected return on $100 bets.

GOOD LUCK!
